# Sudoku Solver

## Overview
Takes a string representation of an unsolved sudoku grid, and solves it.

## Implementation
The simple python implementation (sudoku.py) repeatedly iterates over the boards attempting to find squares that can only have one possible value based on the rules of Sudoku. Each time it updates the board with a value, it iterates again.

There is an unfinished alternative solution that uses recursion (sudoku_recursive.py)
